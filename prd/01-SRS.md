## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 5. Constraints

- Must use TanStack (Start/Router/Query) for frontend
- Must use Supabase for database, auth, storage
- Budget-conscious: prefer free-tier services where possible for a student/portfolio project

## 6. Assumptions

- Single currency, single region shipping initially (extensible later)
- Payment gateway sandbox/test mode acceptable for demo purposes

## 7. Traceability

Each FR above should map to at least one entry in `05-Test-Plan.md` test cases before being marked "done".
