## Critical Path

```
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 10
                              ↓
                         Phase 6 (Admin parallel)
                         Phase 7 (can start after Phase 4)
                         Phase 8 (starts after Phase 4)
                         Phase 9 (starts after Phase 5)
```

## Dependencies

- **Phase 1** blocks everything (schema must exist first)
- **Phase 2** blocks Phase 4, 5, 7 (auth required for cart/orders/wishlist)
- **Phase 3** can partially overlap with Phase 2
- **Phase 4** blocks Phase 5, 8 (checkout flow needed for orders/emails)
- **Phase 6** can run in parallel with Phase 4-5
- **Phase 10** can only fully start after Phase 4-5 complete

## Payment Method: Cash on Delivery (COD)

> **Note:** Stripe is not available in Pakistan. The project uses Cash on Delivery (COD) as the payment method.

**How COD works in this project:**

1. Customer adds items to cart → proceeds to checkout
2. Customer fills shipping address + selects shipping method
3. Customer reviews order and clicks "Place Order"
4. Order is created directly in Supabase with status `pending`
5. Stock is decremented in a DB transaction (race condition protection)
6. Customer sees order confirmation with COD instructions
7. Admin can later update order status (paid, shipped, delivered, etc.)

**Future:** Stripe can be added later when available in Pakistan by:

- Adding Stripe Edge Functions (4.9-4.12 equivalent)
- Adding webhook handler for payment confirmation
- Keeping COD as an alternative payment option
